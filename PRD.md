### 🏁 Go-to-Market Strategy

4. Collect testimonials

**Phase 2: Early Adopters (Month 2-4)**

1. Create case study from pilot
2. Target 10 Chamas in Nairobi

5. Referral incentive (1 month free per referral)

**Phase 3: Sacco Expansion (Month 4-8)**

**Optimistic:**

### 🎯 Key Assumptions to Validate

1. ✅ Chamas/Saccos will pay for gamification
2. ✅ Gamification increases savings rates (proven in research)
3. ❓ $200/month is acceptable price point
4. ❓ Can achieve 60%+ challenge completion
5. ❓ SMS/WhatsApp is sufficient (no native app needed for MVP)

### 🚧 Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low willingness to pay**

- Mitigation: Prove ROI quickly, offer money-back guarantee

**Risk 2: M-Pesa integration complexity**

- Mitigation: Use sandbox extensively, have fallback manual verification

**Risk 3: Low engagement even with gamification**

- Mitigation: A/B test different challenge types, learn from gaming apps

**Risk 4: Regulatory changes**

- Mitigation: Don't hold money, stay as "software only"

### 📞 Next Steps

1. Validate with 5 Chama leaders (interviews)
2. Build landing page + waitlist
3. Get 20 signups before building
4. Start MVP development
5. Launch pilot in 6-8 weeks
